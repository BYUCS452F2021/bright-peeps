# Bright Peeps - Pitch

### *Share inspiration, get inspired!*

<br/>

## Project Description

The internet is already a dark place with plenty of platforms to bring people down, so why not have a place where we can build them up instead? We will build a social platform for people to share other people that inspired them in some way. Be it someone who wrote the Declaration of Independence or another who wrote a really good brownie recipe, Bright Peeps is the place to make that known to the world. In our platform, users will be able to see people's names (aliases and nicknames are fine), photos, a short description, and a list of works and/or accomplishments.

## Team

Looking for other 4 bright CS peeps to join in and make the internet a brighter place. 

## Implementation

The proposed tech stack is as follows (open and subject to change):
- Two types of databases:
    - MySql as the relational database of choice
    - Mongo DB as the NoSQL database of choice
- ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- Some JavaScript framework for the frontend
    - Vue.js?
    - React?
    - Angular?

## BOLTS

### Business

Simple, open-source business plan. Our software will be available free-of-charge for users, and its content will be user generated. We can have a donatinon system in place too, so we can fund the app's hosting and development.

### Operation

Open-source operation. The Bright Peeps foundation will head development, but the community can also help when needed/wanted.

### Legal

The business will be a Utah LLC.

### Technical

1. Design and Develop database
2. Build backend
3. Build front-end

### Social

We will gain customers through advertising on campus, although relying mainly on word of mouth. As we grow, we'll establish a marketing department to use social media.
