# Bright Peeps - Pitch

### *Share inspiration, get inspired!*

<br/>

## Project Description

The internet is already a dark place with plenty of platforms to bring people down, so why not have a place where we can build them up instead We will build a social platform for people to share other people that inspired them in some way. Be it writing the Declaration of Independence or writing a really good brownie recipe, Bright Peeps is the place to make that known to the world. In our platform, users will be able to see people's names (aliases and nicknames are fine), photos, a short description, and a list of works and/or accomplishments.

## Team

Looking for other 4 bright CS peeps to join in and make the internet a brighter place. 

## Implementation

The proposed tech stack is as follows (open and subject to change):
- Two types of databases:
    - MySql as the relational database of choice
    - Mongo DB as the NoSQL database of choice
- ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- Some JavaScript framework for the frontend
    - Vue.js?
    - React?
    - Angular?
